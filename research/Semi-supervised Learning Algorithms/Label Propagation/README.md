## Label Propagation Algorithm

Welcome to the MachineAlgoBox repository! In this README, we'll dive into the Label Propagation algorithm, a popular semi-supervised learning technique, and learn how to use it effectively.

### What is Label Propagation?

Label Propagation is a semi-supervised learning algorithm used for classification tasks, especially when you have a small amount of labeled data and a large pool of unlabeled data. It's a graph-based algorithm that leverages the similarity between data points to propagate labels from labeled instances to unlabeled ones.

The key idea behind Label Propagation is that similar data points should have similar labels. It constructs a graph where each data point is a node, and edges represent similarity between data points. Then, it iteratively updates the labels of unlabeled data points based on the labels of their neighboring data points.

### How to Use Label Propagation

To use the Label Propagation algorithm in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have the required libraries installed. Label Propagation is often implemented in Python using libraries like Scikit-Learn. You can install it using pip:

   ```
   pip install scikit-learn
   ```

2. **Import Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries in your Python script or Jupyter Notebook:

   ```python
   from sklearn.semi_supervised import LabelPropagation
   ```

3. **Prepare Your Data**: Load your dataset and split it into labeled and unlabeled portions. Make sure to have a clear separation between the two.

4. **Create and Train the Model**:

   ```python
   # Create a LabelPropagation instance
   label_propagation = LabelPropagation()

   # Fit the model using labeled and unlabeled data
   label_propagation.fit(X_labeled, y_labeled)
   ```

   - `X_labeled`: Features of the labeled data.
   - `y_labeled`: Corresponding labels for the labeled data.

5. **Predict with the Model**:

   ```python
   # Predict labels for unlabeled data
   predicted_labels = label_propagation.predict(X_unlabeled)
   ```

   - `X_unlabeled`: Features of the unlabeled data.

6. **Evaluate and Fine-Tune**: Evaluate the performance of your model using appropriate metrics and fine-tune the algorithm as needed.

7. **Use the Model**: Once you're satisfied with the model's performance, you can use it to make predictions on new, unlabeled data.

8. **Documentation**: For more details and advanced usage, refer to the [Scikit-Learn documentation on Label Propagation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/label_propagation.html).
