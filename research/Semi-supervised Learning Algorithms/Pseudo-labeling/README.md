## Pseudo-labeling

Welcome to the MachineAlgoBox repository! In this README, we'll explore Pseudo-labeling, a semi-supervised learning technique that leverages unlabeled data to enhance the performance of machine learning models.

### What is Pseudo-labeling?

Pseudo-labeling is a semi-supervised learning technique used when you have limited labeled data but access to a larger pool of unlabeled data. The basic idea is to train a model on the labeled data and then use that model to predict labels for the unlabeled data. These predicted labels, known as pseudo-labels, are then combined with the original labeled data to create an augmented training dataset. The model is retrained on this combined dataset, and the process is repeated iteratively to improve model performance.

Pseudo-labeling is effective when the distribution of the unlabeled data is similar to the labeled data, and the model's predictions on unlabeled data are reasonably accurate.

### How to Use Pseudo-labeling

To utilize Pseudo-labeling in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have the required machine learning libraries installed. Libraries such as Scikit-Learn or deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch can be used. Install the necessary library and dependencies as needed.

2. **Import Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries in your Python script or Jupyter Notebook:

   ```python
   # Example for using Scikit-Learn for Pseudo-labeling
   from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
   ```

3. **Prepare Your Data**: Load your dataset and split it into labeled and unlabeled portions. Make sure you have a clear separation between the two.

4. **Create and Train the Model**:

   ```python
   # Create a base classifier
   class BaseClassifier(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
       def __init__(self, base_model):
           self.base_model = base_model

       def fit(self, X, y):
           self.base_model.fit(X, y)

       def predict(self, X):
           return self.base_model.predict(X)

   # Train a base classifier on the labeled data
   base_model = BaseClassifier(base_model)
   base_model.fit(X_labeled, y_labeled)
   ```

   - `X_labeled`: Features of the labeled data.
   - `y_labeled`: Corresponding labels for the labeled data.
   - `base_model`: The base classifier or model you want to use for Pseudo-labeling.

5. **Generate Pseudo-labels**:

   ```python
   # Use the trained base model to predict labels for unlabeled data
   pseudo_labels = base_model.predict(X_unlabeled)
   ```

   - `X_unlabeled`: Features of the unlabeled data.

6. **Create an Augmented Dataset**:

   ```python
   # Combine labeled data with pseudo-labeled data
   X_combined = np.concatenate((X_labeled, X_unlabeled), axis=0)
   y_combined = np.concatenate((y_labeled, pseudo_labels), axis=0)
   ```

7. **Retrain the Model**:

   ```python
   # Retrain the model on the augmented dataset
   model.fit(X_combined, y_combined)
   ```

8. **Evaluate and Iterate**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics. You can iterate the process by using the newly trained model to generate better pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and retraining the model until convergence.

9. **Documentation**: Refer to the documentation of the library you're using for Pseudo-labeling (e.g., [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/semi_supervised.html#self-training-aka-pseudo-labeling)) for more details and advanced usage.
