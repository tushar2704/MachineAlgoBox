## Self-Training

Welcome to the MachineAlgoBox repository! In this README, we'll explore Self-Training, a semi-supervised learning technique that iteratively improves model performance by leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data.

### What is Self-Training?

Self-Training is a semi-supervised learning approach designed to enhance the performance of machine learning models when labeled data is limited. It leverages a small amount of labeled data and a larger pool of unlabeled data. The process involves iteratively training a model on the labeled data and then using that model to predict labels for the unlabeled data. The predicted labels are added to the labeled set, and the model is retrained. This process is repeated until convergence.

Self-Training can be effective when the distribution of the unlabeled data is similar to that of the labeled data, and the model's predictions on unlabeled data are reasonably accurate.

### How to Use Self-Training

To utilize Self-Training in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have the required machine learning libraries installed. Libraries such as Scikit-Learn or deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch can be used. Install the necessary library and dependencies as needed.

2. **Import Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries in your Python script or Jupyter Notebook:

   ```python
   # Example for using Scikit-Learn for Self-Training
   from sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
   ```

3. **Prepare Your Data**: Load your dataset and split it into labeled and unlabeled portions. Make sure you have a clear separation between the two.

4. **Create and Train the Model**:

   ```python
   # Create a base classifier
   class BaseClassifier(BaseEstimator, ClassifierMixin):
       def __init__(self, base_model):
           self.base_model = base_model

       def fit(self, X, y):
           self.base_model.fit(X, y)

       def predict(self, X):
           return self.base_model.predict(X)

   # Train a base classifier on the labeled data
   base_model = BaseClassifier(base_model)
   base_model.fit(X_labeled, y_labeled)
   ```

   - `X_labeled`: Features of the labeled data.
   - `y_labeled`: Corresponding labels for the labeled data.
   - `base_model`: The base classifier or model you want to use for Self-Training.

5. **Generate Pseudo-Labels**:

   ```python
   # Use the trained base model to predict labels for unlabeled data
   pseudo_labels = base_model.predict(X_unlabeled)
   ```

   - `X_unlabeled`: Features of the unlabeled data.

6. **Combine Labeled and Pseudo-Labeled Data**:

   ```python
   # Combine labeled data with pseudo-labeled data
   X_combined = np.concatenate((X_labeled, X_unlabeled), axis=0)
   y_combined = np.concatenate((y_labeled, pseudo_labels), axis=0)
   ```

7. **Retrain the Model**:

   ```python
   # Retrain the model on the combined dataset
   model.fit(X_combined, y_combined)
   ```

8. **Evaluate and Iterate**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics. You can iterate the process by using the newly trained model to generate better pseudo-labels for the unlabeled data and retraining the model until convergence.

9. **Documentation**: Refer to the documentation of the library you're using for Self-Training (e.g., [Scikit-Learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/label_propagation.html#self-training-aka-self-training)) for more details and advanced usage.
