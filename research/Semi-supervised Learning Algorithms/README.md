# MachineAlgoBox

Welcome to MachineAlgoBox! This repository is dedicated to providing a collection of commonly used Semi-supervised Learning Algorithms, along with their implementations from scratch and practical use cases. Whether you are a beginner or an experienced practitioner, this repository aims to be a valuable resource for understanding and applying Semi-supervised Learning algorithms.

## Introduction
Semi-supervised Learning is a subfield of machine learning that combines elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning. It leverages a small amount of labeled data along with a larger amount of unlabeled data to make predictions or extract useful information. This repository focuses on providing a comprehensive collection of Semi-supervised Learning algorithms to help you tackle problems where obtaining labeled data is expensive or time-consuming.

## Algorithms Included

MachineAlgoBox currently includes the following Semi-supervised Learning Algorithms:


1)Self-training:
    Self-training is a simple approach where a model is trained on the labeled data and then used to make predictions on unlabeled data. The confident predictions are added to the labeled set, and the process is iterated.

2)Label Propagation:
    Label Propagation algorithms use the similarity between data points to propagate labels from labeled instances to unlabeled ones in a graph or network.

3)Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines (S3VM):
    S3VM extends traditional Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to work with both labeled and unlabeled data. It aims to find a decision boundary that minimizes classification error on labeled data and simultaneously maintains a margin of separation from unlabeled data.

4)Co-Training:
    Co-Training is a semi-supervised algorithm that uses multiple models, each trained on a different view or subset of the data. It assumes that these views are conditionally independent given the labels and can help improve performance when views provide complementary information.

5)Tri-Training:
    Tri-Training is an extension of Co-Training that uses three models instead of two. It reduces the risk of making erroneous decisions when using only two models.

6)Multi-view Learning:
    Multi-view learning methods leverage multiple representations or views of the data to improve learning accuracy. These can be useful for semi-supervised learning when different views contain complementary information.

7)Multi-instance Learning:
    Multi-instance learning deals with datasets where the labels are assigned to bags of instances rather than individual instances. It is often used in semi-supervised scenarios where some bags are labeled and others are not.

8)Deep Generative Models:
    Deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) can be adapted for semi-supervised learning by incorporating labeled data into the training process.

9)Transductive Support Vector Machines (TSVM):
    TSVM is an extension of traditional SVMs designed for semi-supervised learning. It seeks to find the decision boundary that best separates the labeled instances while respecting the distribution of the unlabeled instances.

10)Pseudo-labeling:
    Pseudo-labeling combines self-training with techniques like confidence thresholding to decide which unlabeled instances to add to the labeled set.

11)Mean-Teacher (MT) Networks:
    MT Networks are used in deep learning and semi-supervised settings. They involve training a model using a teacher-student paradigm, where the teacher network is an exponential moving average of the student network, helping stabilize training on unlabeled data.

12)Mixture Models:
    Mixture models like Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) can be used in semi-supervised learning to model the distribution of both labeled and unlabeled data points.

##### Each algorithm will have its dedicated folder containing code implementations, relevant documentation, and examples.

## Implementations

In this repository, you will find implementations of the Semi-supervised Learning algorithms from scratch using popular programming languages such as Python, R, or Julia. The implementations will be accompanied by detailed explanations, comments, and usage examples, making it easier to understand the underlying concepts and code.

## Use Cases

Semi-supervised Learning algorithms have various applications, especially in scenarios where labeled data is limited. This repository aims to provide real-world use cases and practical examples for each algorithm. You will find examples demonstrating how to leverage the algorithms to improve classification accuracy, enhance clustering results, or extract additional insights from data.
