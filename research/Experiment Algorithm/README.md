## Introduction

Experiment Algorithms are a class of algorithms that are specifically designed for conducting experiments and optimizing experimental processes. They help in efficiently exploring the experimental design space, analyzing experimental data, and making informed decisions based on experimental results. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Experiment algorithms, helping you conduct experiments effectively.

## Algorithms Included

MachineAlgoBox currently includes the following Experiment Algorithms:

- Latin Hypercube Sampling
- Sequential Experimental Design
- Response Surface Methodology
- Bayesian Optimization
- [Add more experiment algorithms]

Each algorithm will have its dedicated folder containing code implementations, relevant documentation, and examples.

## Implementations

In this repository, you will find implementations of the Experiment algorithms from scratch using popular programming languages such as Python, R, or Julia. The implementations will be accompanied by detailed explanations, comments, and usage examples, making it easier to understand the underlying concepts and code.

## Use Cases

Experiment Algorithms have diverse applications across various domains, including engineering, scientific research, and industrial processes. This repository aims to provide real-world use cases and practical examples for each algorithm. You will find examples demonstrating how to apply the algorithms to optimize experimental parameters, reduce experimental costs, and improve experimental outcomes.
