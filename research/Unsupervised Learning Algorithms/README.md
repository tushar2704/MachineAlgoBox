## Introduction

Unsupervised Learning is a subfield of machine learning where models are trained on unlabeled data to discover patterns, relationships, or underlying structures in the data. This repository focuses on providing a comprehensive collection of Unsupervised Learning algorithms to help you gain insights from your data.

## Algorithms Included

MachineAlgoBox currently includes the following Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:

- Clustering Algorithms:
  - K-means
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - [Add more clustering algorithms]

- Dimensionality Reduction Techniques:
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
  - t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
  - [Add more dimensionality reduction techniques]

- Association Rule Learning:
  - Apriori Algorithm
  - [Add more association rule learning algorithms]

Each algorithm will have its dedicated folder containing code implementations, relevant documentation, and examples.

## Implementations

In this repository, you will find implementations of the Unsupervised Learning algorithms from scratch using popular programming languages such as Python, R, or Julia. The implementations will be accompanied by detailed explanations, comments, and usage examples, making it easier to understand the underlying concepts and code.

## Use Cases

Unsupervised Learning algorithms have diverse applications across various domains, including customer segmentation, anomaly detection, and data visualization. This repository aims to provide real-world use cases and practical examples for each algorithm. You will find examples demonstrating how to apply the algorithms to solve specific problems, extract meaningful insights, and explore data patterns.
