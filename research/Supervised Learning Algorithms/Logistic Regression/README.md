# MachineAlgoBox - Logistic Regression

![logistic-regression](https://example.com/logistic-regression.png)

This repository is part of the MachineAlgoBox project, a collection of commonly used Supervised Learning Algorithms with implementations from scratch and practical use cases. The goal of this repository is to provide a valuable resource for beginners and experienced practitioners to understand and apply the Logistic Regression algorithm.

## Logistic Regression Overview
Logistic Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for binary classification problems. It estimates the probability that an instance belongs to a particular class. The algorithm models the relationship between the input features and the binary target variable using the logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function. Logistic Regression is widely used in various domains, including healthcare, finance, and marketing.

## Implementation
In this repository, you will find a comprehensive implementation of Logistic Regression from scratch, using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy. The implementation includes the following files:

- `logistic_regression.py`: Contains the implementation of the LogisticRegression class, which encapsulates the training and prediction functionalities.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for data preprocessing, such as feature scaling and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- `example.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of the LogisticRegression class on a sample dataset.

## Practical Use Cases
Logistic Regression can be applied to various real-world problems, such as:

- Predicting whether an email is spam or not based on its content and metadata.
- Determining whether a patient has a particular disease based on their symptoms and medical history.
- Classifying customer churn based on their behavior and transactional data.

Feel free to explore the implementation and adapt it to your own datasets or use cases. The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the Logistic Regression class and visualize the results.

## Getting Started
To get started with Logistic Regression, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MachineAlgoBox.git`
2. Navigate to the Logistic Regression directory: `cd MachineAlgoBox/LogisticRegression`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open the example notebook: `jupyter notebook example.ipynb`
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to understand and use the Logistic Regression implementation.
