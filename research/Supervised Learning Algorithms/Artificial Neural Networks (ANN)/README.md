![artificial-neural-networks](https://example.com/artificial-neural-networks.png)

This repository is part of the MachineAlgoBox project, a collection of commonly used Supervised Learning Algorithms with implementations from scratch and practical use cases. The goal of this repository is to provide a valuable resource for beginners and experienced practitioners to understand and apply the Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) algorithm.

## Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) Overview
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) are a class of machine learning models inspired by the structure and functionality of biological neural networks. ANN consists of interconnected nodes called artificial neurons or "neurons." These neurons process and transmit information through weighted connections. ANN can learn from examples and generalize to new inputs, making them powerful models for tasks such as classification, regression, and pattern recognition.

## Implementation
In this repository, you will find a comprehensive implementation of Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) from scratch, using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy. The implementation includes the following files:

- `neural_network.py`: Contains the implementation of the NeuralNetwork class, which encapsulates the training and prediction functionalities.
- `layers.py`: Provides implementations of different types of layers used in the neural network, including fully connected layers, activation layers, and more.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for data preprocessing, such as one-hot encoding and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- `example.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of the NeuralNetwork class on a sample dataset.

## Practical Use Cases
Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) can be applied to various real-world problems, such as:

- Image classification tasks, such as recognizing handwritten digits or identifying objects in images.
- Natural language processing tasks, such as sentiment analysis or text generation.
- Predicting stock prices based on historical financial data.

Feel free to explore the implementation and adapt it to your own datasets or use cases. The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the NeuralNetwork class and visualize the results.
