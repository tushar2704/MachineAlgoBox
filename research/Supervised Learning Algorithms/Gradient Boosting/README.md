# MachineAlgoBox - Gradient Boosting

![gradient-boosting](https://example.com/gradient-boosting.png)

This repository is part of the MachineAlgoBox project, a collection of commonly used Supervised Learning Algorithms with implementations from scratch and practical use cases. The goal of this repository is to provide a valuable resource for beginners and experienced practitioners to understand and apply the Gradient Boosting algorithm.

## Gradient Boosting Overview
Gradient Boosting is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple weak learners, typically decision trees, to create a strong predictive model. It works by iteratively training new models that focus on correcting the mistakes made by previous models. Gradient Boosting is known for its ability to handle complex data patterns and deliver high predictive performance.

## Implementation
In this repository, you will find a comprehensive implementation of Gradient Boosting from scratch, using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy. The implementation includes the following files:

- `gradient_boosting.py`: Contains the implementation of the GradientBoosting class, which encapsulates the training and prediction functionalities.
- `decision_tree.py`: Provides the implementation of the DecisionTree class used as weak learners within the Gradient Boosting algorithm.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for data preprocessing, such as handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- `example.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of the GradientBoosting class on a sample dataset.

## Practical Use Cases
Gradient Boosting can be applied to various real-world problems, such as:

- Predicting customer churn based on customer behavior and demographic features.
- Credit risk assessment using financial and credit-related variables.
- Object detection and recognition in computer vision tasks.

Feel free to explore the implementation and adapt it to your own datasets or use cases. The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the GradientBoosting class and visualize the results.
