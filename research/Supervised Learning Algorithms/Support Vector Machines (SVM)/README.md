# MachineAlgoBox - Support Vector Machines (SVM)

![support-vector-machines](https://example.com/support-vector-machines.png)

This repository is part of the MachineAlgoBox project, a collection of commonly used Supervised Learning Algorithms with implementations from scratch and practical use cases. The goal of this repository is to provide a valuable resource for beginners and experienced practitioners to understand and apply the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm.

## Support Vector Machines (SVM) Overview
Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a powerful supervised learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. SVM finds an optimal hyperplane that maximally separates the classes in the input feature space. It aims to find the best decision boundary by maximizing the margin between the support vectors. SVM is known for its ability to handle high-dimensional data and its effectiveness even with small training sets.

## Implementation
In this repository, you will find a comprehensive implementation of Support Vector Machines (SVM) from scratch, using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy. The implementation includes the following files:

- `support_vector_machines.py`: Contains the implementation of the SVM class, which encapsulates the training and prediction functionalities.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for data preprocessing, such as feature scaling and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- `example.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of the SVM class on a sample dataset.

## Practical Use Cases
Support Vector Machines (SVM) can be applied to various real-world problems, such as:

- Classifying spam emails based on text content and metadata features.
- Detecting fraudulent transactions based on transactional data and user behavior patterns.
- Recognizing hand-written digits based on image features.

Feel free to explore the implementation and adapt it to your own datasets or use cases. The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the SVM class and visualize the results.
