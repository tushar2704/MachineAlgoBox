# MachineAlgoBox - Decision Trees

![decision-trees](https://example.com/decision-trees.png)

This repository is part of the MachineAlgoBox project, a collection of commonly used Supervised Learning Algorithms with implementations from scratch and practical use cases. The goal of this repository is to provide a valuable resource for beginners and experienced practitioners to understand and apply the Decision Trees algorithm.

## Decision Trees Overview
Decision Trees are supervised learning algorithms used for both classification and regression tasks. They create a model that predicts the value of a target variable based on a set of input features. Decision Trees divide the input space into regions and assign a class or value to each region. The algorithm constructs the tree by recursively partitioning the data based on feature values, optimizing for purity or information gain. Decision Trees are widely used due to their interpretability and ability to handle both numerical and categorical data.

## Implementation
In this repository, you will find a comprehensive implementation of Decision Trees from scratch, using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy. The implementation includes the following files:

- `decision_trees.py`: Contains the implementation of the DecisionTree class, which encapsulates the training and prediction functionalities.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for data preprocessing, such as feature encoding and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- `example.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of the DecisionTree class on a sample dataset.

## Practical Use Cases
Decision Trees can be applied to various real-world problems, such as:

- Predicting customer churn based on demographic and behavioral features.
- Identifying spam emails based on text and metadata features.
- Estimating the likelihood of loan default based on borrower characteristics.

Feel free to explore the implementation and adapt it to your own datasets or use cases. The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the DecisionTree class and visualize the results.

## Getting Started
To get started with Decision Trees, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MachineAlgoBox.git`
2. Navigate to the Decision Trees directory: `cd MachineAlgoBox/DecisionTrees`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open the example notebook: `jupyter notebook example.ipynb`
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to understand and use the Decision Tree implementation.
