## Introduction

Supervised Learning is a subfield of machine learning where models are trained on labeled data to make predictions or classify new, unseen instances. This repository focuses on providing a comprehensive collection of Supervised Learning algorithms, including both traditional machine learning algorithms and deep learning models.

## Algorithms Included

MachineAlgoBox currently includes the following Supervised Learning Algorithms:

- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forests
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- [Add more algorithms as you include them]

Each algorithm will have its dedicated folder containing code implementations, relevant documentation, and examples.

## Implementations

In this repository, you will find implementations of the Supervised Learning algorithms from scratch using popular programming languages such as Python, R, or Julia. The implementations will be accompanied by detailed explanations, comments, and usage examples, making it easier to understand the underlying concepts and code.

## Use Cases

Supervised Learning algorithms have a wide range of applications across various domains. This repository aims to provide real-world use cases and practical examples for each algorithm. You will find examples demonstrating how to apply the algorithms to solve regression problems, classification tasks, and other relevant scenarios. The use cases will showcase the algorithms' capabilities and guide you in leveraging them effectively in your own projects.
