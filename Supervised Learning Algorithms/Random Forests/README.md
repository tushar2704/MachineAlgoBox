# MachineAlgoBox - Random Forests

![random-forests](https://example.com/random-forests.png)

This repository is part of the MachineAlgoBox project, a collection of commonly used Supervised Learning Algorithms with implementations from scratch and practical use cases. The goal of this repository is to provide a valuable resource for beginners and experienced practitioners to understand and apply the Random Forests algorithm.

## Random Forests Overview
Random Forests is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple Decision Trees to create a more robust and accurate predictive model. It works by constructing a multitude of Decision Trees on different subsets of the training data and averaging their predictions. Random Forests mitigate overfitting and improve generalization performance compared to individual Decision Trees. They are versatile and widely used for both classification and regression tasks.

## Implementation
In this repository, you will find a comprehensive implementation of Random Forests from scratch, using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy. The implementation includes the following files:

- `random_forests.py`: Contains the implementation of the RandomForest class, which encapsulates the training and prediction functionalities.
- `decision_trees.py`: Contains the implementation of the DecisionTree class used within the Random Forests algorithm.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for data preprocessing and ensemble techniques.
- `example.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of the RandomForest class on a sample dataset.

## Practical Use Cases
Random Forests can be applied to various real-world problems, such as:

- Predicting customer churn in a telecom industry based on various customer attributes.
- Identifying fraudulent transactions based on transactional data and user behavior.
- Estimating the price of a used car based on its features and historical sales data.

Feel free to explore the implementation and adapt it to your own datasets or use cases. The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the RandomForest class and visualize the results.

## Getting Started
To get started with Random Forests, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MachineAlgoBox.git`
