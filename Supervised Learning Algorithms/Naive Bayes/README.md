# MachineAlgoBox - Naive Bayes

![naive-bayes](https://example.com/naive-bayes.png)

This repository is part of the MachineAlgoBox project, a collection of commonly used Supervised Learning Algorithms with implementations from scratch and practical use cases. The goal of this repository is to provide a valuable resource for beginners and experienced practitioners to understand and apply the Naive Bayes algorithm.

## Naive Bayes Overview
Naive Bayes is a simple yet effective probabilistic machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It is based on Bayes' theorem and assumes that features are conditionally independent given the class label. Despite its "naive" assumption, Naive Bayes performs well in many real-world applications and is particularly useful when dealing with high-dimensional data.

## Implementation
In this repository, you will find a comprehensive implementation of Naive Bayes from scratch, using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy. The implementation includes the following files:

- `naive_bayes.py`: Contains the implementation of the NaiveBayes class, which encapsulates the training and prediction functionalities.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for data preprocessing, such as feature extraction and handling categorical variables.
- `example.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of the NaiveBayes class on a sample dataset.

## Practical Use Cases
Naive Bayes can be applied to various real-world problems, such as:

- Text classification tasks, such as spam detection or sentiment analysis.
- Document categorization based on textual content.
- Medical diagnosis or disease prediction based on symptoms and patient information.

Feel free to explore the implementation and adapt it to your own datasets or use cases. The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the NaiveBayes class and visualize the results.

## Getting Started
To get started with Naive Bayes, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MachineAlgoBox.git`
2. Navigate to the Naive Bayes directory: `cd MachineAlgoBox/NaiveBayes`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open the example notebook: `jupyter notebook example.ipynb`
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to understand and use the Naive Bayes implementation.
