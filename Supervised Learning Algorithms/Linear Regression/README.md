# MachineAlgoBox - Linear Regression

![linear-regression](https://example.com/linear-regression.png)

This repository is part of the MachineAlgoBox project, a collection of commonly used Supervised Learning Algorithms with implementations from scratch and practical use cases. The goal of this repository is to provide a valuable resource for beginners and experienced practitioners to understand and apply the Linear Regression algorithm.

## Linear Regression Overview
Linear Regression is a supervised learning algorithm used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one or more input features. It assumes a linear relationship between the input features and the target variable. The algorithm fits a straight line to the training data, minimizing the difference between the predicted and actual values, and uses this line to make predictions on new data.

## Implementation
In this repository, you will find a comprehensive implementation of Linear Regression from scratch, using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy. The implementation includes the following files:

- `linear_regression.py`: Contains the implementation of the LinearRegression class, which encapsulates the training and prediction functionalities.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for data preprocessing, such as feature scaling and splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- `example.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of the LinearRegression class on a sample dataset.

## Practical Use Cases
Linear Regression can be applied to various real-world problems, such as:

- Predicting house prices based on features like area, number of bedrooms, and location.
- Estimating the sales volume of a product based on advertising expenditure.
- Analyzing the relationship between a student's study time and their exam scores.

Feel free to explore the implementation and adapt it to your own datasets or use cases. The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the Linear Regression class and visualize the results.

## Getting Started
To get started with Linear Regression, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MachineAlgoBox.git`
