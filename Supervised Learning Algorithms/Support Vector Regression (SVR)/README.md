# MachineAlgoBox - Support Vector Regression (SVR)

![support-vector-regression](https://example.com/support-vector-regression.png)

This repository is part of the MachineAlgoBox project, a collection of commonly used Supervised Learning Algorithms with implementations from scratch and practical use cases. The goal of this repository is to provide a valuable resource for beginners and experienced practitioners to understand and apply the Support Vector Regression (SVR) algorithm.

## Support Vector Regression (SVR) Overview
Support Vector Regression (SVR) is a variation of the Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm used for regression tasks. SVR constructs a hyperplane in a high-dimensional feature space to minimize the error between the predicted output and the actual target values. SVR is particularly useful when dealing with non-linear relationships and can handle both continuous and categorical input features.

## Implementation
In this repository, you will find a comprehensive implementation of Support Vector Regression (SVR) from scratch, using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy and scikit-learn. The implementation includes the following files:

- `svr.py`: Contains the implementation of the SVR class, which encapsulates the training and prediction functionalities.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for data preprocessing, such as feature scaling and handling missing values.
- `example.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of the SVR class on a sample regression dataset.

## Practical Use Cases
Support Vector Regression (SVR) can be applied to various real-world problems, such as:

- Stock price prediction based on historical financial data.
- Housing price estimation using relevant features like location, size, and amenities.
- Demand forecasting in supply chain management based on historical sales data.

Feel free to explore the implementation and adapt it to your own datasets or use cases. The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the SVR class and visualize the results.

## Getting Started
To get started with Support Vector Regression (SVR), follow these steps:
