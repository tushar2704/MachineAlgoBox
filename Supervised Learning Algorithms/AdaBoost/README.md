# MachineAlgoBox - AdaBoost

![adaboost](https://example.com/adaboost.png)

This repository is part of the MachineAlgoBox project, a collection of commonly used Supervised Learning Algorithms with implementations from scratch and practical use cases. The goal of this repository is to provide a valuable resource for beginners and experienced practitioners to understand and apply the AdaBoost algorithm.

## AdaBoost Overview
AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is an ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple weak learners to create a strong classifier. It iteratively trains weak models on different subsets of the training data, giving more weight to misclassified samples in each iteration. AdaBoost is particularly effective when dealing with complex classification tasks and can handle both numerical and categorical input features.

## Implementation
In this repository, you will find a comprehensive implementation of AdaBoost from scratch, using Python and popular libraries such as NumPy and scikit-learn. The implementation includes the following files:

- `adaboost.py`: Contains the implementation of the AdaBoost class, which encapsulates the training and prediction functionalities.
- `weak_learner.py`: Provides the implementation of the WeakLearner class, representing the base model used in AdaBoost.
- `utils.py`: Provides utility functions for data preprocessing, such as feature encoding and handling imbalanced datasets.
- `example.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating the usage of the AdaBoost class on a sample classification dataset.

## Practical Use Cases
AdaBoost can be applied to various real-world problems, such as:

- Image classification tasks, such as object recognition or face detection.
- Credit scoring and fraud detection in financial institutions.
- Medical diagnosis based on patient characteristics and symptoms.

Feel free to explore the implementation and adapt it to your own datasets or use cases. The Jupyter Notebook provides a step-by-step guide on how to use the AdaBoost class and visualize the results.

## Getting Started
To get started with AdaBoost, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/MachineAlgoBox.git`
2. Navigate to the AdaBoost directory: `cd MachineAlgoBox/AdaBoost`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Open the example notebook: `jupyter notebook example.ipynb`
5. Follow the instructions in the notebook to understand and use the AdaBoost implementation.
