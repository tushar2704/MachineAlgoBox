## Introduction

NLP (Natural Language Processing) and LLM (Language Modeling) are crucial subfields of artificial intelligence that focus on the understanding, analysis, and generation of human language. They enable machines to comprehend and generate text, extract meaningful insights, and facilitate human-computer interaction. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of NLP and LLM algorithms, helping you solve language-related problems efficiently.

## Algorithms Included

MachineAlgoBox currently includes the following NLP and LLM Algorithms:

- Text Preprocessing (Tokenization, Stop Word Removal, etc.)
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Sentiment Analysis
- Topic Modeling (e.g., Latent Dirichlet Allocation - LDA)
- Language Modeling (e.g., Transformers, LSTM)
- [Add more NLP and LLM algorithms]

Each algorithm will have its dedicated folder containing code implementations, relevant documentation, and examples.

## Implementations

In this repository, you will find implementations of the NLP and LLM algorithms from scratch using popular programming languages such as Python, R, or Julia. The implementations will be accompanied by detailed explanations, comments, and usage examples, making it easier to understand the underlying concepts and code.

## Use Cases

NLP and LLM algorithms find applications in various domains such as sentiment analysis, information retrieval, machine translation, chatbots, and text generation. This repository aims to provide real-world use cases and practical examples for each algorithm. You will find examples demonstrating how to apply the algorithms to perform sentiment analysis, extract entities from text, generate text, and solve other language-related tasks.
