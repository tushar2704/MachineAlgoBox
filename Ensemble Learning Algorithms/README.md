## Introduction

Ensemble Learning is a machine learning technique that combines multiple models to make better predictions or classifications than any individual model. It leverages the wisdom of the crowd by aggregating the predictions of several models. This repository aims to provide a comprehensive collection of Ensemble Learning algorithms, helping you harness the power of ensemble methods for improved performance.

## Algorithms Included

MachineAlgoBox currently includes the following Ensemble Learning Algorithms:

- Bagging (Bootstrap Aggregating)
- Boosting (AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost)
- Random Forests
- Stacking
- [Add more ensemble learning algorithms]

Each algorithm will have its dedicated folder containing code implementations, relevant documentation, and examples.

## Implementations

In this repository, you will find implementations of the Ensemble Learning algorithms from scratch using popular programming languages such as Python, R, or Julia. The implementations will be accompanied by detailed explanations, comments, and usage examples, making it easier to understand the underlying concepts and code.

## Use Cases

Ensemble Learning algorithms have proven to be highly effective in various domains, including classification, regression, and anomaly detection. This repository aims to provide real-world use cases and practical examples for each algorithm. You will find examples demonstrating how to apply the algorithms to improve predictive accuracy, handle imbalanced datasets, and deal with noisy or uncertain data.

## Contributing
