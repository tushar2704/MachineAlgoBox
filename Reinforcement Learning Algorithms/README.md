## Introduction

Semi-supervised Learning is a subfield of machine learning that combines elements of both supervised and unsupervised learning. It leverages a small amount of labeled data along with a larger amount of unlabeled data to make predictions or extract useful information. This repository focuses on providing a comprehensive collection of Semi-supervised Learning algorithms to help you tackle problems where obtaining labeled data is expensive or time-consuming.

## Algorithms Included

MachineAlgoBox currently includes the following Semi-supervised Learning Algorithms:

- Self-training
- Co-training
- Generative Models (e.g., Generative Adversarial Networks - GANs)
- [Add more semi-supervised learning algorithms]

Each algorithm will have its dedicated folder containing code implementations, relevant documentation, and examples.

## Implementations

In this repository, you will find implementations of the Semi-supervised Learning algorithms from scratch using popular programming languages such as Python, R, or Julia. The implementations will be accompanied by detailed explanations, comments, and usage examples, making it easier to understand the underlying concepts and code.

## Use Cases

Semi-supervised Learning algorithms have various applications, especially in scenarios where labeled data is limited. This repository aims to provide real-world use cases and practical examples for each algorithm. You will find examples demonstrating how to leverage the algorithms to improve classification accuracy, enhance clustering results, or extract additional insights from data.
