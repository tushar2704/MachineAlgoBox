## Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines (Semi-Supervised SVM)

Welcome to the MachineAlgoBox repository! In this README, we'll explore Semi-Supervised Support Vector Machines (Semi-Supervised SVM), a variant of traditional SVMs that leverages both labeled and unlabeled data to improve classification performance.

### What is Semi-Supervised SVM?

Semi-Supervised SVM is a semi-supervised machine learning technique that extends the capabilities of traditional Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to handle scenarios where labeled data is limited but unlabeled data is abundant. It combines the principles of SVM with the advantages of semi-supervised learning, where unlabeled data is used to regularize the decision boundary.

Semi-Supervised SVMs are particularly effective when labeled data is scarce, making them valuable in various applications, including image classification, text categorization, and anomaly detection.

### How to Use Semi-Supervised SVM

To utilize Semi-Supervised SVM in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have the required machine learning libraries installed. Libraries such as Scikit-Learn or specialized SVM libraries can be used. Install the necessary library and dependencies as needed.

2. **Import Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries in your Python script or Jupyter Notebook:

   ```python
   # Example for using Scikit-Learn for Semi-Supervised SVM
   from sklearn import svm
   from sklearn.semi_supervised import SelfTrainingClassifier
   ```

3. **Prepare Your Data**: Load your dataset and preprocess it if necessary. Organize your data into labeled and unlabeled sets. Make sure you have a clear separation between the two.

4. **Create and Train the Model**:

   ```python
   # Create a base SVM classifier
   base_classifier = svm.SVC(probability=True, kernel='linear')

   # Create a Self-TrainingClassifier (Semi-Supervised SVM)
   semi_supervised_svm = SelfTrainingClassifier(base_classifier)

   # Train the model on the combined dataset (labeled + unlabeled)
   semi_supervised_svm.fit(X_combined, y_combined)
   ```

   - `base_classifier`: The base SVM classifier.
   - `X_combined`: Features of the combined dataset (labeled + unlabeled).
   - `y_combined`: Corresponding labels for the combined dataset.

5. **Predict with the Model**:

   ```python
   # Make predictions using the semi-supervised SVM
   predictions = semi_supervised_svm.predict(X_test)
   ```

   - `X_test`: Features of the test data.

6. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, ROC curves). You can also fine-tune hyperparameters as needed.

7. **Documentation**: Refer to the documentation of the library you're using for Semi-Supervised SVM (e.g., [Scikit-Learn SelfTrainingClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/whats_new/v0.24.html#id11)) for more details and advanced usage.
