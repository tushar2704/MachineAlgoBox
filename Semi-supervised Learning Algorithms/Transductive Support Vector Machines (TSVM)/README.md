## Transductive Support Vector Machines (Transductive SVM)

Welcome to the MachineAlgoBox repository! In this README, we'll explore Transductive Support Vector Machines (Transductive SVM), a variant of traditional SVMs designed to handle semi-supervised learning scenarios by exploiting both labeled and unlabeled data.

### What is Transductive SVM?

Transductive SVM is a semi-supervised machine learning technique that extends traditional Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to make predictions for both labeled and unlabeled data points while optimizing the decision boundary. Unlike traditional SVMs that focus on labeled data, Transductive SVM uses unlabeled data to refine the decision boundary and improve classification performance.

Transductive SVM is particularly useful when labeled data is limited, but there is access to a significant amount of unlabeled data that can provide valuable information.

### How to Use Transductive SVM

To utilize Transductive SVM in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Installation**: Ensure you have the required machine learning libraries installed. Libraries such as Scikit-Learn or specialized SVM libraries can be used. Install the necessary library and dependencies as needed.

2. **Import Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries in your Python script or Jupyter Notebook:

   ```python
   # Example for using Scikit-Learn for Transductive SVM
   from sklearn import svm
   from sklearn.semi_supervised import LabelSpreading
   ```

3. **Prepare Your Data**: Load your dataset and preprocess it if necessary. Organize your data into labeled and unlabeled sets. Make sure you have a clear separation between the two.

4. **Create and Train the Model**:

   ```python
   # Create a base SVM classifier
   base_classifier = svm.SVC(probability=True, kernel='linear')

   # Create a LabelSpreading (Transductive SVM) model
   transductive_svm = LabelSpreading(base_classifier=base_classifier)

   # Train the model on the labeled data
   transductive_svm.fit(X_labeled, y_labeled)
   ```

   - `base_classifier`: The base SVM classifier.
   - `X_labeled`: Features of the labeled data.
   - `y_labeled`: Corresponding labels for the labeled data.

5. **Predict with the Model**:

   ```python
   # Make predictions using the Transductive SVM for both labeled and unlabeled data
   predictions_labeled = transductive_svm.predict(X_labeled)
   predictions_unlabeled = transductive_svm.predict(X_unlabeled)
   ```

   - `X_unlabeled`: Features of the unlabeled data.

6. **Evaluate the Model**: Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, ROC curves). You can fine-tune hyperparameters as needed.

7. **Documentation**: Refer to the documentation of the library you're using for Transductive SVM (e.g., [Scikit-Learn LabelSpreading](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/label_propagation.html#transductive-propagation)) for more details and advanced usage.
